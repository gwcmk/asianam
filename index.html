				<p id="intro-p">The Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965 began a surge of immigration that included many East Asian people (Wong 1986). Between then and now, Asian Americans have attained marked economic success; in many states, they have higher median household income than whites (not including hispanic or latino). Other minority groups have lived in the United States longer than this wave of Asian immigrants, but they have not achieved nearly the same level of economic success. One prevailing stereotype that attempts to explain this phenomenon is that Asian Americans are the model minority, but this idea is problematic and inaccurate. The model minority myth has negative effects on the lives of Asian Americans and fails to account for the hyper-selectivity of Asian immigrants. The circumstances under which many Asian people immigrated to the United States is the most significant reason for their economic success.</p>

				<p>The common view of Asian Americans as the model minority leads to stereotype threat, meaning that Asian Americans are expected to be quiet, hardworking, and studious people (Lee and Zhou 2015:116). While this is considered good behavior, especially in academic settings, the expectations of this behavior has patently adverse effects on the lives of Asian Americans. Outside of academic contexts, passiveness and obedience to authority are often not beneficial characteristics. As a result of the public perception of these characteristics, in television and film, Asian Americans are typecast into stereotypical and unimportant roles. Leading male roles are rarely Asian, and female Asian actors are frequently fetishized as exotic foreigners. Beyond that, in order to find success in the industry, Asian Americans must overcome the model minority stereotype because it does not fit a desirable actor archetype. Even in environments where the model minority stereotype may seem to be advantageous, it can be detrimental. Asian Americans account for 50% of the high-tech workforce in the San Francisco Bay Area, but only 8% of board members and 12% of executives (Lee and Zhou 2015:134). This pattern can be observed across the United States within the field of engineering (Tang 1993).</p>
				<p><a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~hist32/Hist33/US%20News%20&%20World%20Report.pdf" target="_blank">In 1966, the U.S. News & World Report published an article titled "Success Story of One Minority Group in U.S."</a> This was the first story that established Asian Americans as the model minority by attributing their success to their cultural values and work ethic (U.S. News & World Report 1966). Moreover, it put down African Americans by questioning why they are not able to achieve the same levels of success as Asian Americans despite having to deal with similar levels of discrimination and prejudice (U.S. News & World Report 1966). This was one of the first cases of white media pitting Asian Americans against other minorities to create racial tensions in order to further white supremacy over the collective black (Bonilla-Silva 2004). Claire Kim detailed this in her theory of racial triangulation by breaking it down into two simultaneous processes: "relative valorization" and "civic ostracism" (1999). Relative valorization refers to the process by which Asian Americans are granted "honorary white" status because of their academic and economic achievement (Kim 1999). By granting Asian Americans this status and comparing the two groups, the lack of upward mobility for African Americans is emphasized. The other process, civic ostracism, maintains the barrier between white and non-white by constructing Asian Americans as a foreign group of people who could never fully assimilate into white culture (Kim 1999). The reasoning behind racial triangulation is built upon the model minority myth. Relative valorization compares Asian Americans to African Americans without any regard for their economic circumstances. Valorization purely based on outcomes suggests that Asian Americans are outperforming African Americans due to cultural differences rather than hyper-selectivity. Then, these same cultural differences are cited in order to distance whites from Asian Americans. Clearly, the model minority myth plays a significant role in a process that is damaging for both Asian Americans and African Americans.</p>
				<p>Since that article was published 50 years ago, there has been plenty of research showing how hyper-selectivity greatly aided Asian immigrants to achieve high levels of success. However, the model minority myth continues to be a prevalent stereotype today. There are a few factors that contribute to the continued relevance of this stereotype. As the population of Asian Americans grows, it becomes increasingly evident that they are overrepresented at the best American high schools and universities due to their high academic achievement  (Lee and Zhou 2015:2). Additionally, there has been psychological research since then that attempts to explain Asian American success by highlighting parts of Asian culture (Vernon 1982). Lastly, advertising, which plays a large role in public opinion, overtly depicts Asian Americans as the model minority by portraying young people as obedient students and adults as hardworking but quiet professionals (Paek and Shah 2003). Given these factors, it is not surprising that the stereotype persists today, but it's important to recognize the more noteworthy factors that play a role in Asian American success.</p>
				<p>According to Lee and Zhou, hyper-selectivity refers to immigrants with higher proportional educational attainment than people of their country of origin and people of their destination country (2015). For example, 50% of Chinese immigrants have a BA or higher, compared to 4% of people living in China and 28% of the general American population (Lee and Zhou 2015). This high level of education offers opportunities to these immigrants that may not be available to immigrants from other countries or African Americans. A college degree can enable Asian immigrants to start businesses or find jobs despite their perceived foreignness and lack of English language skills. This offers a clear explanation for why Asian immigrants tend to achieve higher levels of success than other minority groups. On the other hand, in countries like Mexico, immigrants can be hypo-selected, and many African Americans are stuck in segregated, low income neighborhoods with below average public school systems.</p>

				<p>The impact of hyper-selectivity extends to the second generation as well. First generation immigrants face many barriers in American society due to a variety of factors. For most, language barriers are significant issues. Even if they attain fluency in English, they face discrimination due to foreign accents (Tang 1993). In addition, when they arrive, they tend to have fewer opportunities due to a lack of general knowledge about American society. However, they were able to overcome these barriers and find success thanks to coethnic communities. Because of hyper-selectivity, Asian immigrants had the resources to form these coethnic communities in which they could share information (Lee and Zhou 2015). These coethnic communities are able to collectively discover valuable information regarding a wide variety of topics such as social norms or the American education system (Lee and Zhou 2015). Members of the community could lean on each other and leverage their collective knowledge base while navigating their new surroundings. Outside of information, these communities also offer other tangible benefits for Asian Americans. Because of the success attained by first generation immigrants, many second generation children grow up in wealthy "ethnoburbs" (Lee and Zhou 2015). For example, in Los Angeles, Chinese Americans have settled into suburbs in the San Gabriel Valley, and these communities have above average public schools and much lower crime rates than the greater Los Angeles metropolitan region (Lee and Zhou 2015). These areas also have many Chinese owned businesses which can offer employment or even monetary loans to second generation Chinese Americans (Lee and Zhou 2015). As expected, these coethnic communities have greatly increased the upward mobility of second generation Asian Americans.</p>

				<p>African Americans do not have access to nearly as many coethnic resources, and this clearly plays a role in their lower levels of upward mobility. Rather than growing up in a coethnic community in which there are many role models and sources of information about education and career advancement, many young black people are surrounded by violence and a lack of adult leadership, circumstances which are perpetuated by discriminatory policy and racism. In addition, the public schools in these lower income neighborhoods are severely underfunded, which makes upward mobility via education extremely difficult (Zhou 1997). In turn, this can form an oppositional culture as a response to frustration regarding the unfairness and lack of opportunity (Zhou 1997). These circumstances can lead to pressures of "downward assimilation" as outlined by Portes's theory of segmented assimilation (Portes 1993). This is just a small part of the discrimination that African Americans face on a systemic level, but it's clear that comparing their economic upward mobility to Asian Americans is not fair or reasonable.</p>
				<p>Perhaps the most straightforward evidence against the model minority myth can be seen in Jessica Yiu's study in Spain. In her study, she found that Chinese immigrants in Spain do not conform to the American model minority stereotype. Instead, they perform worse academically than students of other nationalities (Yiu 2013). The reason for this is that Chinese immigrants in Spain have found upward mobility through small businesses rather than education (Yiu 2013). These small businesses were able to find startup capital largely due to the existence of coethnic communities in Spain (Yiu 2013). The findings of this study are relevant to the role of hyper-selectivity in Asian American economic success in two ways. Firstly, it dispels the notion that academic achievement is somehow inherent to Asian culture. Secondly, it further highlights the importance of coethnic communities. Because of the coethnic communities in Spain, Chinese immigrants were able to find a path to upward mobility and financial success in spite of discrimination.</p>
				<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/opinion/sunday/the-asian-advantage.html" target="_blank">Major news publications continue to attribute Asian American success to the model minority myth</a>, but hyper-selectivity's role in Asian American success is apparent. Ethnic enclaves and the abundance of economic and social capital has enabled Asian Americans to find a plethora of opportunities that are not available to other minorities in the United States. Recognizing this reality is important not only for factual correctness, but also for relieving unnecessary and damaging racial tensions.</p>
